# Day 4 - Notes

## Python
- Today I learned about exception handling in python.
- Exception handling uses try-except-finally to catch errors gracefully instead of letting the program crash

-Why does it matter in Data Engineering?
1. Pipe Reliability
2. Data Quality Control
3. Logging and Monitoring
4. Graceful recovery 

## SQL
-Today i SQL, i learned about the Group By and Having clause
- Group by Clause is is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
-Often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
-Having clause is used to filter groups of rows after an aggregation (group by)
-It works like where, but where cannot be used with aggregrate functions
